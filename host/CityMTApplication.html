<h2>When and how did you become a Christian?</h2>

<p>Summer of 2007 during a youth group camp to the Lake District. Having started
going to youth group in order to keep up with friends from school, I went to
the camp a few times to enjoy the activities; walking, sailing etc; but never
applied the talks to myself. One evening, the third year I was there, I was
particularly struck be the lyrics of the songs we had sung so talked about them
with a friend.</p>

<p>A couple of evenings later there was a time of reflection after one of the
talks and God softened my heart to Him. I know that it was not anything I had
achieved, or that the talk or the band had been particularly good that night,
but that God had chosen that moment to reveal himself to me. I understood that
I knew God existed, then just had to deal with what that meant for me, my life,
my view of the world and my place in it.</p>

<p>I prayed about what I'd learnt with the leader of the week and the same friend
I had talked to previously in the hope of getting some idea of where to go from
here. Returning home that year felt much the same as any other. My family were
not Christians so going back to no communal exposure to God felt normal. It
took a long time to decide to start going to church, to CU and to actually
listen to what I needed to learn.</p>

<p>My walk since has been very bumpy, I feel I have grown slowly and fallen often,
but the opportunity to see how much God has changed me, to be able to look back
at my life before I knew Christ and compare it with where He has brought be
thus far feels like an enormous privilege.</p>

<h2>How do you think that you have grown as a Christian since you came to university?</h2>

<p>Having only been to church at home for a few years before coming to university,
I think I have grown most in my appreciation for God's family in the Church.
The opportunity to experience church life in somewhere completely new was a big
learning challenge. I realised that there was vast areas of Godly living I
hadn't realised I knew nothing about.</p>

<p>I was involved in a reasonably long term relationship and reluctantly learnt
about prioritising God above everything. And have grown in my understanding of
God, the gifts he has given me and the ways in which I can use them for Him.</p>

<h2>What would you say are you main gifts and strengths?</h2>

<p>The way in which I have felt most able to bless the church is through
behind-the-scenes serving. I feel that I have been able to use my skills in
things like computing to serve during worship and in the day to day running of
a church. I have had some opportunities to lead groups and be involved in youth
ministry and I think that my science background and own walk has helped me
witness to teenagers struggling with the questions and doubts that often arise
at that age.</p>

<h2>What opportunities have you had to make use of these gifts so far?</h2>

<p>I've been lucky enough to serve as a leader for a few years on the camp where I
became a Christian. Doing things like sound and lyrics for talks, multimedia
like videos and the website and leading discussion groups and seminars there.
I've served on the PA rota at City for a year or so and have led a small group
for the CU. Many of these opportunities were difficult learning experiences but
I feel that they have been invaluable in my walk with God, learning to trust
Him in the gifts that He gives me and learning that they are from Him and for
Him.</p>

<h2>What would you say are your main weaknesses?</h2>

<p>Since becoming a Christian, I have seen myself fall in many areas of life and
give into temptation. I feel that I have struggled particularly in the past
with motivation to trust God when I feel distant from Him. The self
exaggerating spiral of feeling distant so not seeking Him, so feeling more
distant etc.</p>

<p>In the more practical areas, I struggle considerably with sharing my walk with
others. I have a great tendency to not seek help until just after it gets to be
a big problem in my life. I tend to justify this by convincing myself that
since I never confided in anyone about Godly matters whilst at home that there
is no need to do it in the rest of my life.</p>

<p>In certain areas of my life, I am also fantastically disorganised. Though this
usually only goes so far as forgetting birthdays or exams, I have difficulty
asking God for help since I find ways of justifying that too. "I'm able to be
flexible with other people and fit into their schedule if I don't know what I'm
supposed to be doing when myself".</p>

<h2>Why would you like to work as a City Church Trainee next year?</h2>

<p>As I've mentioned, my primary gift, I feel, is quietly serving and I would like
to give back to City Church as a place where I have been fed and encouraged. I
do not know what God has planned for my life, but the opportunity to serve
in a church, to see the work that goes into the family and to contribute to
that work would be, hopefully, encouraging and an opportunity to investigate
the gifts He has given me further.</p>

<h2>Are there any areas in which you would particularly like to serve if you were to be appointed as a trainee?</h2>

<p>I would like to be able to serve in the practical areas, as this is, I feel,
where I am gifted particularly. Areas such as the PA rota, where I already help
out, and setup/down and preparation for church and midweek activities. I'd also
be keen to get involved with the youth ministry and/or the creche aged kids at
the church as theses are areas I have been a part of at the camp I help on and
have enjoyed and found myself useful there.</p>

<h2>What training would you like to receive if you were appointed?</h2>

<p>I'd like to develop my skills when ministering to young people, below
university age. I'd like to be able to help with the leading of a youth group
when I am able to (be that at City or later when I am working) as I was so
encouraged when I attended one myself, and it was going to one that originally
exposed me to the gospel.</p>

<h2>How would spending a year or two as a trainee benefit you in the light of your plans for the future?</h2>

<p>I am not completely sure what my plans for the future are. I'm considering
teaching, in which case a year with City would provide me with valuable
experience with the diverse range of ages that are part of the church. I'd very
much value the opportunity to serve the church after having been guided and
blessed by it.</p>

<h2>Do you think that you would enjoy the support of your family and your home church to work as a City Ministry Trainee next year?</h2>

<p>I know that I would have the support of both my parents and my home church,
though I do not suppose that my decision to delay work for another year would
best please my parents, who aren't Christians. They know of people working for
the church voluntarily having spoken to my house-mate, working at another
church in Selly Oak, but I do not think that they would not expect me to chose
that route.</p>

<p>My home church, however, has some links with City church and I know that I
would have their support.</p>

<h2>What will you do if you are not offered the chance to work as a City Trainee?</h2>

<p>I am currently looking to work in the computer industry in some capacity. My
tentitive plans are to work in industry for a few years to get some experience
of life in "the real world", outside education, and then, providing I am still
eager to, move into secondary teaching.</p>

<h2>Anything else you would like to mention in your application?</h2>

<p>My appologies for the verbosity of some of my responses. Thank you for
considering me.</p>

<p>Best</p>

<p>Josh.</p>
