I have used for some time now, the fantastically versatile
[mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/) for playing videos (and just about any other
sort of media file), but when it came to needing to edit some video, I found
that I had almost no experience at all.

##Setup

My requirements were for a simple to learn, non-linear video editor that I could
apply a few effects - slow-mo, transitions - add a single background music
track, and either handle a range of video formats or convert them for me.

The video file that I had was from an Olympus camera and was a .mts format. This
is a high definition format for the AVCHD (Audio Visual Codec High Definition)
codec. It actually uses MPEG-4 and Dolby sound compression, so I assumed it
would be fairly simple to deal with.

I ended up trying out three different editors.

##[iMovie](http://www.apple.com/uk/ilife/imovie/)

I'll confess, my first route was to assume that a semi-decent Mac, pre-installed
i knew, with iMovie, would be my best bet. However it simply refused point
blank to talk with my mts file. I tried a number of programs on this Mac, and
short of paying $25 for a converter, I found nothing that could deal with this
format, let along give me a simple interface to edit it with.

##[Pitivi](http://www.pitivi.org)

This was, I think, the only editor that I had previously heard of. It boasts a
wide range of features, most outside the scope of my project, but had good
reviews. On installing however, I found that while it may have seemed easy to
use, it was almost impossible to find out what was wrong when it didn't work as
expected.

##[OpenShot](http://www.openshot.org)

My final attempt was with an editor I had not heard of before, and seemed to be
billed as a much simpler afair than others. Though not stooping to Windows Movie
Maker level, OpenShot does provide far fewer knobs and dial to play with, though
there are more than I first gave it credit for - hidden in `Clip Properties`.

Though the handling of smallish files was not great (I had managed to convert
the epic 1.6GB .mts file into a more modest 300MB MPEG), I accidentaly just
threw OpenShot the raw .mts and boom! OpenShot did what nothing else had managed
and just let me get on with things.

Though the finished result was nothing spectacular, I found that after much
messing and faffing with fancy Mac apps and "professional" video suites, the top
trump was a simple Unix work horse.

**Update**
Turns out OpenShot has very recently completed a KickStarter campaign so could
be getting some love and care and attention that would only serve to improve
this cabable program. See more details [here](http://www.openshotvideo.com/2013/08/kickstarter-rewards-have-started.html).
