Just a very quick thought here.

Why is it that websites so often promote the "Sign up here" button, but leave
the "Login" equivalent hidden away in some corner?

Obviously I know why, because sites are more interested in getting new users
than providing a simple easy interface for existing ones. Its just been drawn to
my attention by the fact that, when visiting the Disqus site, which I use for
comments on this blog, I spent around 30 seconds looking for the button that
said, in small blue letters on a blue background, "login".

Thats not a good demonstration of how they view me as a customer.
