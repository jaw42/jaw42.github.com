title: Big Day - End of subl
---
Today marks a big change in the landscape of my workflow - I have just
uninstalled Sublime Text.

After becoming my favorite editor and being used to improve my workflow
throughout my final year at uni last year, I decided to push myself to try out
Vim for longer than I had previously given it. Not long after getting to grips
with some of the simpler movements, I found myself customising more and more
until I feel that I am ready to take the safety net away.

Though ST2/3 has gained a fantastic (and well deserved) following, I feel that
vim, with its extraordinary and wide reaching, movement and editing style, and
the bewildering number of plugins, can serve me full time.

I'll try to mention some vim tips and plugins when I come across them - more as
a reminder for myself than anything.
