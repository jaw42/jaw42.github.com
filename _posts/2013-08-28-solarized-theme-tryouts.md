title: "Solarized Theme Tryouts"

A while ago, I stumbled on a theme project for Linux and Mac platforms. At the
time, I though that was extremely sad. A whole project, and a significant amount
of work, on some pokey colour scheme.

Since then, my work has meant that I spend a whole lot longer on the command
line, and in Vim, and, as such, I have come to appreciate the difference a well
designed theme can have on the readability of code, and the strain on the eyes.

For that reason, and cause, why not?, I have decided to take a more thorough
look at that theme. Its called
*[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)* and provides two
complementary themes, a light and a dark. I'm currently using the dark version
(see the website for _all_ the info and some pics and many other things.)

Apparently, its designed to use satisfyingly complementary colours, so opposite,
triad, etc. on the colour wheel, but to also minimise the strain on the eyes of
using a really high contrasting colour theme.

The nice thing about the amount of work that has obviously been put into it,
apart from the fact that it is a nice looking theme, is that there are versions
of the theme to be used in many different programs. Since trying it out for less
that 10 minutes last time, I thought I'd go the whole hog, so I'm using these
variations on the theme:

- Vim
- Mutt
- Xresourses
- XTerm
- xfce-terminal

Thats not a bad list of dependencies, and all of them programs that I happen to
have installed and use regularly. And, since they are all already written and
hosted on [Github](https://github.com/altercation/solarized), they are an
absolute doddle to install in most cases (all except xterm, but I ended up
setting a few other things up at the same time, post on that little adventure to
come.) We'll see how we go.

Thanks for the excellent theme!
