title:  "First Post With Jekyll"
---
Recently, I decided to take another foray into the bloggin world, and have decided
that a more down to earth approach was needed. To this end, this is the first
blog post that is using the Jekyll blog aware static site generating framework.

Basically, I'm writing this post in markdown (simple as you like), it'll then be
interpreted by Jekyll which whill compile it, and all subsequent posts into a
blog to be served from the github servers. All I have to do on this end, once
setup, is write the posts and push via git. Simple.

We'll see how we go. This should allow the process of blogging to be much more
native to my setup - vim to edit, git to manage, etc. - and so more natural.

#And it works!

I know nothing has happened there, but as I'm writing this, I'm testing it out.
I just hit save, navigated to the webpage as hosted locally for the moment, and
there was the link to this new post.

**Update**
After playing around with the various bits and pieces of my website for the past
couple of hours, I now have a website hosted on Github, created by myself,
structured by Jekyll. So far, it seems to be a great bit of tech. I can throw in
more pages and posts and the links and all pages will be updated accordingly.

I'm sure there are many more parts that I shall have to work out, but for now,
I'm liking this.
