#GNU/Linux

I use GNU/Linux as my primary opperating system. My distro of choice is Arch
Linux. Below are a collection of Unix-related musings and useful items related
to that area.

##[Current Setup](/unix/setup.html)

This is a quick run-down of my current setup on my Arch Linux laptop.

##[Scripts](/unix/scripts/)

This is a collection of scripts that I have either written myself or collected
and, in most cases, edited to my liking. Most of them are hosted on GitHub, so
any suggestions for improvements will gladly be taken there. If any of these are
yours, please let me know and I will give you the recognition you deserve.

##[Fortune](/unix/fortune.html)

Fortune is a great little program for displaying random quotes/jokes/facts etc.
Have a look here for more info and a collection of my favorite fortune cookies,
and a few I've made myself.
