#Current Setup

This is a list of the programs that I currently use. Almost all of
them are executed by my [universal open](scripts/universalopen.html) script which means that the defaults can change accross all
locations that they might be started from
.
See the [bottom](#bottom) of this page for a more general
list of programs I use.
