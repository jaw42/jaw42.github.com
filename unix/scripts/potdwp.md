#POTDWP

The National Geographic magazine has a Picture of the Day every day.  This
simple script downloads that image and sets it as the background image.

It uses nitrogen by defualt, but can be easily setup to use feh, or any other
simple wallpaper setting program. The script downloads the file for today and
the old image from yesterday and uses one for each monitor. This way, each
monitor in my two monitor setup has a different interesting image to display as
the background every day.

Usually, the National Geographic will provide a link to a high resolution
version of the image. If availible, that is downloaded and used, if not, then
the smaller sample on the webpage is used instead and the user notified.
